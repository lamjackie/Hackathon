    <p style="text-align:center">We all had a common problem in my team and that was keeping track of graduation requirements. The many categories of credits and </br> 
  the types of service hours got us confused. So, we decided to create PATH.  PATH is geared towards high school and college students. It is designed </br> 
to make tracking credits and service hours easier by having it online and spread out properly. Like we said before, PATH helps keep your credits </br> 
and hours organized by having a table to clearly see what else you need to have a successful school career. The table is expandable as you began to put more hours in </br> 
and credits in. This simple and mess free way to organize is perfect for students. We built and designed this website by using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. We used JavaScript </br>
for the expanding table and then CSS for the rest of the decoration and the color of the website. We chose to use the 60-30-10 rule for the color scheme consisting </br> 
of #FBFBFB, #54D4F0, and #00C3A1. Then we used HTML for the rest of the website from the navigation bar to the rounded team member pictures. In the </br>
future, we are planning to further expand the design of our website throughout  and make it even better. We hope in the future to be able to </br>
implement PATH for use into school districts around the country.</p>
